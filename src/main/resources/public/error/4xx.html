    <h1>RailWatch Proxy</h1>
    <p>This service provides up-to-date departure times for trains on a given route, and can send notifications of changes to an Android device if requested.</p>
    <p>It's very much a work-in-progress, and documentation will be written when the service becomes generally available.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, here's <a href="https://github.com/Cyanelix/railwatchproxy">the GitHub project</a>, or <a href="http://www.cyanelix.com">Cyanelix's website</a>.</p>
    <p>Version: @project.version@</p>
